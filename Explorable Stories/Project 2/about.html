                    <b>Overview</b>
                    <p>
                        Manas' Tea is supposed to provide users information about China/Shanghai's tea cultue and history. As the users engage in the different stages of making a tea, they are exposed to some important information about Shanghai and it's tea culture. I have used this approach because I think it is easier to absorb information when it is presented in a step by step manner. Moreover, by associating the various steps of making tea to the information about that particular step, users will be able to retain the information for a longer time. Hopefully, after going through the experience, interactors will have better awareness about different tea cups, pots and leaves as well as some idea about the nutritional value of the different tea types.

                        <b>Learning</b>
                        <br>
                        <ol>
                            <li>The first thing I learnt was how to use a template. Basically, I got comfortable with going through someone else's written code and was able to customize it to a huge extent aprt from a few shortcomings. This involved a lot of back and forth navigation through different files that had different template functions to get an idea of what different things meant. For instance, the scroll function, that is responsible for going through different divs within the same page, was already defined. I had to understand its working to implement it where I wanted. I was doing a lot of front end web dev which I think I have gotten better at thanks to this project. Minor things like positioning, margins, padding are clearer to me now. </li><br>
                            <li>I 'learnt' Chart js. Altough, after using it(even though for just 4 charts) I felt as if there wasn't much to learn here. The library is very straightforward and easy and consequently not very powerful. Making charts are simple here.</li><br>
                            <li>I have become familiar with HTML5 Canvas animations. Although I am not sure whether I can make my own complex animations, I can understand the code and customize it. I learnt this while I was customizing a steam animation(for the hot cup of tea) and a waterfall animation to show freshwater used in the tea. I did not use these because of positioning issues </li>
                        </ol>
                    </p>
                     <p>
                        <b>Challenges/Mistakes</b>
                        <br>
                        So for the porject I used a template which was a mistake now that I think about it. First, the template was very complicated and it took me quite some time to understand the overall framework. Second, the template was very limiting in terms of the features that I could add into it. Each div in the template was attached to extensive css styling. Moreover, all the classes were connected to each other in a very delicate and intricate manner i.e. I barely had any freedom in terms of what I could edit without messing up the overall template look. Third, Adding any animations using a library became very difficult, partly because of the second reason. I spent a lot of time trying to figure out ways to add p5 animations, html5 canvas animations to the divs within the template but there would always be problems that I could not solve without abandoning the template.<br>
                        I used the template because I wasn't sure whether I would be able to finish the project or not and so I wanted to have at least a decent front end display. At least the template was able to do that to some extent.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Another thing that really bothered me was that I wasn't really able to do any 'real' coding. I spent most of my time on the HTML file dealing with classes and ids which was really frustrating and monotonous. My HTML file has around 450 lines of code as opposed to my JS file that has around 150. Although that is not a good indicator of the effort I put in, I still think I would have enjoyed writing more JS stuff rather than the copy-pasting or classes and divs that I was doing.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I think my experience in this class was influenced by Mashups to a huge extent. From the beginning of this project I thought of this project in terms of the technology I should use based on the guidelines i.e. use a library to make a website. I did not pay a lot of attention to the story part and because of that I was lost when I decided to use three js and an api and had no idea what story I would want to work on. So, I had to discard my first idea and then come up with a story that I am interested in.Then I started thinking about the technology I could use.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If I could do this project again, I would work on developing a simulation of the Tea Ceremony. Rune gave me this idea during the user testing. Although it would have been difficult, I think I could have managed it if I had figured it out in the beginning.
