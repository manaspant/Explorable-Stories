    			The feedback I got today was helpful and I will try to incorporate some of it into my project by Friday. Although my ‘story’ isn’t still very clear to me, I still got some interesting ideas about the kinds of interactive features that I could bring in.<br>
				In terms of the cube someone recommended that I could give people some contextual information about pollution based on its effects on health of individuals. For instance, I could tell people the air quality averages in some other countries to give people an idea of the difference between the one in Shanghai and other places. Other ideas that I got were also quite similar in these aspects. Overall, I think there is an inclination towards connecting the pollution to its harmful effects on the health of the people here and doing something with this correlation.
				So, my goals for Friday at this point are, to finalize my story and incorporate some user interactivity.

    			I definitely need a lot of feedback at this point. For my final project, I’m using data on Shanghai’s air quality and want to tell a story using that data about the city’s level of air pollution. I am very keen on using three JS Library to visualize my data in some interesting way. At this point,
    			<br>
				<li>I have been able to make an ajax call and am able to log my data from the API. </li>
				<li>I am also able to customize a three JS example while I’m trying to understand this language.</li>
				<br>My three questions are:<br>
				<li>What story should I tell about the air pollution exactly? After I get the data, what should I do with it? Should I make a map that shows different levels of pollution across different regions or should I or should I do something with the interactive cube that I have right now? </li>
				<li>What kinds of interactivity should I bring into my project? Based on the idea that I finalize based on the above question, should I put some clickable things on the interactive cube(or whatever) or should I introduce some hover feature?</li>
				<li>Can someone help me understand three JS?</li>

    			For our first project, Keshar and I are working to develop what we will call ‘The Interactive Bund’. We want to build an online and interactive version of the bund that will give the user/interactor information about the different buildings of the Skyline of Pudong visible from the Bund and the changing landscape of that area. We haven’t decided yet if we want to focus on the Skyline of the Pudong area or also on the buildings of the Zhongshan road on the opposite site. 
				We have chosen to work with the Bund as we consider it to be the most iconic site in Shanghai. When people google Shanghai, they don’t see images of any of the traditional and old buildings or other historic sites but that of the bund. Moreover, after going to the museums, we are able to appreciate the bund even more because of its relevance in Shanghai’s history. It is located at the intersection of foreign influence and local culture, finance and tradition. We think that it is a good representation of the spirit of Shanghai.
				We want to tell the story of the Bund’s development over time and its buildings. Hopefully, through our project the user will be able to appreciate Shanghai’s growth and development through the time period and the different influences.

				I am most excited to visit the Fuxing Park. This is because I think it will be an interesting experience to visit a park in the city that has so many tall structures made out of concrete. There is so much infrastructural development here that it becomes difficult for me to imagine a park in the middle of the city with its greenery and trees etc. Moreover, the park itself also has a rich history. It was made by the French Concession in Shanghai and once used to be the largest park in the city. It’ll be exciting to the French influence play out in a park in China. <br>
				I think that the visit to the park might help me come up with some ideas about what I want to work on for my final project. I am also looking forward to clicking some good pictures of this scene.
				I am also interested in seeing what the K11 mall will look like. I find malls fascinating because they are a good blend of local traditional goods and imported products. I want to see the extent to which Chinese products dominate the malls in comparison to foreign brands or vice versa. In Abu Dhabi, I have noticed that foreign brands are often taking up most of the space but that could possibly be because of the huge expat population. In China, where the citizens are in the majority it’ll be interesting to see what the malls will be like.

				In the final year of my school, I was the only student from the social sciences to participate in a science innovation competition. In this contest, students are supposed to do something 'innovative' in the field of science. Of course, we weren't supposed to come up with some breakthrough innovations in the field but nevertheless, we had to work on something creative and somewhat original. 
				Most of my peers who took part in this were studying Physics, Chemistry and Maths. Naturally, most of them started working on theories that they had been taught in the class ex. working on some novel practical application of the doppler effect. 
				I was initially very intimidated by all these complicated project that I had no understanding of. However, I started focusing on my own project.
				Since there were very few tools at my intellectual disposal in terms of science, I decided to make a wind powered mobile charger with my friend. We decided to make this using recyclable items. Although, I do not remember the exact process of making the charger, I remember being able to complete it and present it on the final day. 
				Some important takeaways from that experience:<br>
				
				<br><li>
					Just like the inventors of the industrial revolution, inventions in the field of science or arguably any field aren't just reserved for people who belong to that field. Coding isn't only meant for computer science majors and a discovery in economics shouldn't be left to economists or mathematicians. 
				</li>
				<br> <li>
					I am divided when I think about whether or not my experience is aligned with the constructionsim put forth by Papert. The environment in my educational setting wasn't really one that focused on providing students the freedom to discover things on their own. Papert talks in the book about how the ideal way to learn is one where you 'learn French in France'. To a huge extent what we were doing in school was learn  French words in a school in Urban India and have no idea how to make sentences. 
					On the other hand, even though the environment wasn't very conducive to constructive learning, I feel that by doing this science project I was able to capture the essence of this theory. I was learning elements of science by using tools at my disposal. There was nobody who was spoonfeeding me exactly what I was supposed to learn and do but I was able to figure that out gradually through trial and error. 
					Papert in his book focuses heavily on this idea of how our education system focuses heavily on progressive learning which is not the right way.
					Our charger won't work and we would constantly make minor changes to see if it helped. This is how we finally were able to make it work.
